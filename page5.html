            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACEDI operates in Africa and has worked on projects in countries such as South Sudan, Sudan, DRC, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.
</p><div>
</div><div><strong>ACEDI currently works in the following thematic areas.</strong></div><div><strong>a. Citizenship, Governance and Social Justice.</strong><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;</span><br></div><div>ACEDI addresses issues of gender equality, corruption and inclusion of minorities such as pastoralists in development planning. ACEDI also has had interest in development of capacities of local government in social accountability and the use of tools to enhance inclusion of the poor in decision making and accountability to them. ACEDI emphasizes in building capacities in the application of rights based approach to development and has been key in supporting a number of NGOs and CBOs in developing tools for mainstreaming Human rights and gender in their work and communities where they are based. ACEDI has been instrumental in building capacities of CBOs in Tanzania on disability rights in Northern Tanzania in the Serengeti area. ACEDI works to empower communities and CBOs to track public expenditure in the sectors of health, education and agriculture and developing accountability forums for leadership to be held accountable. 
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>b.	Natural resources Management.</strong></div><div>ACEDI addresses issues of local knowledge processes and culture in the conservation of critical biodiversity. Forestry and REDD issues are central to our interventions in the Albertine rift valley. Developing alternative energy sources are other key interventions ACEDI is working on. Oil exploration, revenue generation and sharing and rights therein are a key concern that ACEDI is researching on and building local communities capacities to demand for their rights in natural resource exploration. In addition ACEDI is working on water provision especially in dry lands among pastoralists and sanitation issues in schools. 
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>c.	Health Systems, OVCs and HIV/AIDS.</strong></div><div>ACEDI is keen to build accountable and efficient health systems through community participation and partnership with local and national governments.  ACEDI supports assistance providers, pregnant and lactating mothers and community based organizations and community members, in order to have a comprehensive peer-to-peer approach that has emerged as a solution to tackling diverse HIV/AIDS and Health related issues as well as tackling geographic isolation especially in hard to reach areas. Community participation in HIV/AIDS capacity building efforts places the community as the 'expert' and facilitates community empowerment and leadership development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACEDI places emphasis on people and communities as agents of their own change. Through participatory communication and popular education ACEDI aims to encourage community empowerment and create an environment that enables change, and addressing of HIV/AIDS and OVC issues in the community making use of a variety of communication media and participatory approaches like REFLECT to amplify the voices and concerns of the most disadvantaged, and bring them into public debate and policy discourses. ACEDI addresses issues of PMTCT and HIV/AIDS prevention and ART literacy among fishing communities, pastoralists and hard to reach areas.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>d.	Education rights.</strong></div><div>Illiteracy among women still presents a challenge for reducing gender parity and is compounded by the absence of an Adult Literacy Policy and ACEDI has made this a priority in addressing education gaps. Under education ACEDI works on Advocacy at local, and national levels on, budget tracking and Partnership with professional bodies to secure commitment and realization of education funding; Lobby government for scaling up and adaptation of Non formal education and promotion of rights in the provision of UPE (formal sector) including accountability and governance and REFLECT methodology for creating strong community led social movements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACEDI also supports community-based initiatives for improved delivery of education services including community monitoring and evaluation processes. In addition ACEDI has been involved in campaigning, advocating, lobbying for and ensuring the education rights of children, orphans and child headed households, working children, children affected by HIV/AIDs and building capacities of NGOs/CBOs, into strong social movements to monitor implementation processes, identify issues and inform policy decisions at the local level. Reduction of child Labour and its impacts in education are now a concern for ACEDI intervention. 
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><br><div><strong>e.	Livelihoods, agriculture and food security.</strong></div><div>Without proper access to markets small holder farmers cannot manage to develop and improve their wellbeing. Small holder farmers need access to capital and appropriate technologies to enhance their production and access to competitive markets. Value addition is the cutting edge for gaining access to markets and ACEDI works to build the capacity of small holder farmers in identifying and accessing innovative agribusiness knowledge and technology and improving their organization and mobilization. In addition ACEDI works with women and local groups to build systems for ensuring food security. Climate change issues are a concern for ACEDI and interventions have been designed to address climate change in agronomic systems and help improve food security for rural households. 
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>f.	Emergencies, conflict and spiritual empowerment.</strong></div><div>Indeed, one of the major causes of poverty around the world is armed conflict, most of which takes place in Africa. In addressing the various causes of poverty, human security has become a new measure of international security and a new impetus for global action. It represents the degree to which human beings are protected from hunger, ignorance, sickness, neglect, and persecution. ACEDI regards conflict as a natural multifaceted phenomenon which when dealt with objectively yields positive change in society. Therefore, conflict resolution and peace building will focus on strengthening of the re-establishment of relationships between individuals and within society to promote unity in diversity. Contributing to peace and stability makes economic sense. </div><div>In order to improve the general humanitarian situation, ACEDI must scale up initiatives in the refugee camps through all the stage of humanitarian continuum - relief, recovery and development while at the same time actively pursue a sustainable and secure holistic empowerment of the refugee both spiritually and physically.
